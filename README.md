# Connect IQ Data Pickers Monkey C Barrels
Better alternatives to some of the Connect IQ built-in data pickers for Vivoactive 3. Originally developed for Vivoactive 3 but compatible with wide range of watches.

See demo apps for examples.

The pickers come from the [Mediate](https://github.com/vtrifonov-esfiddle/Meditate) app ([app store link](https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/bed7ed4d-07ea-4600-b477-b8911670b64a)).
